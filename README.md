Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.


In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
